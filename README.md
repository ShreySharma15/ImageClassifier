# 🦊 Image Classification using CNN

This is a deep learning project built using **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit**, designed to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** into one of 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.  

This project demonstrates training a **Convolutional Neural Network** and deploying it as a **web app** using Streamlit.

You can access the live demo here:
 👉 [**CIFAR-10 Image Classifier**](https://shadowfox-image-classifier.streamlit.app/) 

## 🚀 Features

- CNN model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset  
- Achieves ~75% accuracy on validation data  
- Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time image prediction  
- Clean and minimal UI  
- Deployed via **Streamlit Cloud**

---

## 🧠 Dataset

We use the **CIFAR-10** dataset, which contains:
- **60,000** 32x32 color images  
- **10 classes** with **6,000 images per class**  
- Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

## 🧩 Model Architecture

A simple CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation  
- MaxPooling layers  
- Dropout for regularization  
- Fully connected Dense layers  
- Softmax output layer for classification  

Trained using **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**.
